# Products Design with Vanilla Tilt.js

This project showcases a creative approach to product design using Vanilla Tilt.js, a lightweight JavaScript library for creating tilt effects on elements.

## Introduction
Vanilla Tilt.js adds a unique interactive dimension to product design by enabling smooth and dynamic tilt animations based on the user's mouse or device movement. This project demonstrates how to integrate Vanilla Tilt.js into product listings or showcases to enhance user engagement and visual appeal.

## Demo
You can view the demo of this project [here](https://ibrahimshafiq4.github.io/product-design/) 

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IbrahimShafiq4/product-design.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd product-design
   ```
3. Include the `vanilla-tilt.js` script in your HTML file:
   ```html
   <script src="path/to/vanilla-tilt.js"></script>
   ```
   Replace `"path/to/vanilla-tilt.js"` with the actual path to the `vanilla-tilt.js` file.

## Usage
1. Create HTML elements for your products that you want to apply the tilt effect to.
2. Add the `data-tilt` attribute to each product element:
   ```html
   <div class="product" data-tilt></div>
   ```
3. Initialize Vanilla Tilt.js for the product elements in your JavaScript file:
   ```javascript
   VanillaTilt.init(document.querySelectorAll('.product'), {
       max: 25,
       speed: 400,
       glare: true,
       'max-glare': 0.5,
   });
   ```
   Customize the tilt options (`max`, `speed`, `glare`, `max-glare`) according to your preference.
